### Overview  
This repository contains the code, data, and results for the Home Credit Default Risk Management project. The primary objective is to build predictive models that assess the credit risk of customers based on historical data provided by the Home Credit dataset.

### Features  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering  
- Model Development (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Model Evaluation and Optimization  
- Visualization of Results  

### Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Home Credit, containing information about customer demographics, credit history, previous payments, and other relevant factors that influence credit risk. You can access the data via the **Home Credit Default Risk** competition on Kaggle or similar platforms.


### Usage  
1. **Data Preparation**: Explore and preprocess the dataset using the `data_preprocessing.py` file.  
2. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models using `train_model.py` and `train_xgboost.py`.  
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance with different metrics in `evaluate_model.py`.

### Modeling Approach  
The repository focuses on predictive modeling using:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Optimization**  

### Evaluation Metrics  
Model performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
